			The purpose of this website is to immitate basic functionalities of a
			common posting system. The main site introduces the developer and contains
			three buttons that offer a simple navigation system between the main page,
			a posting system page and a post search page.

			<!-- Question 1-->
			<strong>Q1. Special Features:</strong>
			<br />Expression of an html website inside a modal, this was accomplished
			with JS. <br />Styling, even though Bootstrap provides considerable
			amounts of styling, I found it necessary to jump onto bootstrap.css and
			edit to my likes which I believed improved the look of the website.
			<br /><br />
			<!-- Question 2-->
			<strong>Q2. Parts I had Trouble:</strong>
			<br />Attempting to display an entire website on a div without including
			libraries seemed a bit of a challenge. At first I attempted to create an
			object and pass it an html, then load it as soon as the modal was opened.
			Unfortunately my function was not displaying the object properly and
			styling had no positive effects. At the end I decided to go to W3Schools
			to create a function that worked.<br /><br />
			<!-- Question 3-->
			<strong>Q3. What would I do Better:</strong>
			<br />Im unexperienced with back end but I know how Globals can be abused.
			I'd like to know how to implement security. <br /><br />
			<!-- Question 4-->
			<strong>Q4. My Sources: </strong>
			<br />W3 Schools, AUTOnline, Bootstrap. <br /><br />
			<!-- Question 5-->
			<strong>Q5. Gained Knowledge: </strong>
			<br />Practice. <br />
			<br />
			<!-- Extra comments -->
			<strong>Extra Comments: </strong>
			<br />Note that at the end of the project in order to add user-friendly
			warnings I had to convert poststatusform to .php <br />
			I thought of adding an .htaccess file so I can do this on an .html file
			but things start to get quite messy. <br />
			<br />
			The Search functionality works in two ways: <br />
			- You can search for certain Status Code.<br />
			- You can search for a string and you will get all Statuses that contain
			that phrase/word/letter on it's Status Message.<br />
